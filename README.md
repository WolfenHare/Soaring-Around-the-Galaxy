# Soaring-Around-the-Galaxy
A hyperspace WebVR experience soaring through a selection of planet across the galaxy.

Made this as a tribute to one of my favorite rides at Disneyland's California Adventure Soaring around the World/California. 

Built with AFRAME webvr and a little bit of pixie dust and a lot of consultation with Wookiepedia. 

All of the textures are custom but some feature real deep space images from our galaxy.
